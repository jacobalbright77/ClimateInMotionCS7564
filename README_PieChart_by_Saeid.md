## ✅ Key Files to Include:

```
📁 public/
  └── full_data.json      ← Temperature data for countries
  └── index.html          ← Main HTML entry point

📁 src/
  └── TemperaturePieChart.js   ← Main React component for the pie chart
  
  └── index.js                 ← App entry point (renders the root)
  └── App.js                   ← May import and render the chart component

📄 package.json           ← Lists dependencies like recharts, scripts, etc.
```
